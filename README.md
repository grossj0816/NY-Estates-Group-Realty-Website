# NY-Estates-Group-Realty-Website
This is a repository for a sample website I am making for my Aunt's Real Estate Firm. I wanted to use the knowledge I have obtained through learning about web development in my intro level course, currently reading the textbook "JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY" by John Duckett to make a website that is fully functional for day to day uses, make this website's user experience enjoyable, and make the website look appealing.
